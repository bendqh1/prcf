# PHP RtL Contact Form

A CMS-agnostic backend-frontend simple contact form for one recpient which is aimed solely for Right to Left (RtL) languages and allows appointment setting to allow service sale automation (SSA) for freelancers or SMEs (with normally one person handling emails).

## Software requirments

This program requires:

* A well configured *DNS records hosting*
* A well configured *websites hosting* 
* A well configured *website emails hosting* comprised by itself of:
  * Local Email Server (**LES**) such as *Postfix*
  * Local Email Protocoler (**LEP**) such as *Dovecot*
  * Local Email Client (**LEC**) such as *Roundcube*

## Language

It was originally designed in Hebrew but one should be able to change the Hebrew to any other RtL language such as Arabic, Aramaic, Persian/Farsi, Azeri, Urdu, Kurdish (Sorani), Dhivehi/Maldivian and probably more.

## Installation

I personally do non-Git installations directly from a shell by calling `install.sh` (after **`cd` WEBSITE DIRECTORY**) and then expanding variables in the backend directory files and in HTML directory homepage.php file.

## Notes

* One might want to ensure that any PHP file is not accessible by a browser, to prevent an hardcoded email address from being leaked to spambots
